STILL DEPLOYING .... DO NOT USE !!!

Ransomware Jail v1.0 Beta

This program creates thousands of dummy files, which are ~150MB in size, and located in [UserName]\$.RwJail folder.
Then the program monitors that folder for any changes (Edit, Rename, Delete, etc.).
When any change happens, the program tries to detect which process caused this change to kill it after notifying the user.
The Monitor process in Task Manager is: "RwJail.exe", and it is scheduled to run with Windows startup.
